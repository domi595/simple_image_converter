# simple_image_converter
Hello! It's my first project - image converter made fully in Python. You can convert your images in it into PNG, JPEG, or GIF. You can choose where you want to save your converted picture, resize images and overwrite existing files.

This project uses the Pillow library to handle image processing tasks such as resizing and format conversion.
